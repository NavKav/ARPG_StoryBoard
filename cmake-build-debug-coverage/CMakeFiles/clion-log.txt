CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Program Files/JetBrains/CLion 2021.1.1/bin/cmake/win/share/cmake-3.19/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:426 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (SDL2_image)
  does not match the name of the calling package (SDL2_Image).  This can lead
  to problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  SDL2/cmake/FindSDL2_image.cmake:91 (FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS)
  CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
